# Genome-scale-Metabolic-model-GEM-
in this code i will give all the necessary code required to make and run and GEM model using Matlab cobra toolbox
This repository contains all the necessary MATLAB codes and resources for creating, analyzing, and simulating genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs). These models are widely used in systems biology to study the metabolic capabilities of organisms, predict phenotypes, and optimize metabolic engineering strategies.

## Introduction
Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) are mathematical representations of the metabolic reactions in an organism. They are used to simulate and predict metabolic behavior under different conditions. This repository provides a collection of MATLAB scripts and functions to:
- Reconstruct a GEM from genomic and biochemical data.
- Perform flux balance analysis (FBA) and other constraint-based modeling techniques.
- Visualize and analyze metabolic networks.
