# Genome-scale-Metabolic-model-GEM-
in this code i will give all the necessary code required to make and run and GEM model using Matlab cobra toolbox
This repository contains all the necessary MATLAB codes and resources for creating, analyzing, and simulating genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs). These models are widely used in systems biology to study the metabolic capabilities of organisms, predict phenotypes, and optimize metabolic engineering strategies.
